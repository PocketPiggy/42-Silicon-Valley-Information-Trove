Yes, it's true. 42 Silicon Valley is shutting down - for good. There have been
a lot of rumors flying around since April that the place was closing down for
good. Down below I have some definitive proof, talking to a current student who
is doing 42 Paris remote, and two past students who was nice enough to give me
a copy of the email & slack notification on 42 Silicon Valley closing down.

<h3> 42 Silicon Valley Goes Remote - An Announcement </h3>

Dear 42 Silicon Valley Students,

In July 2016, we opened our doors and held our very first Piscine and in September the same year, also welcomed our first wave of students. In the four years since then, we've seen hundreds of students turn into amazing coders and leaders, and helped them jumpstart their careers.

We've had a lot of fun, hosting over 300 events, volunteering with community organizations and at tech conferences, and our favorite - seeing many alumni return to share their experiences with new 42SV members!

This year has been a hard one for many organizations in the US and we've seen many changes everywhere. After careful consideration and review from our leadership, and due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 42 Silicon Valley will be shifting into a more sustainable remote-only curriculum, supported by the 42Network headquarters in Paris, France.

By the 3rd of November you will all be switched to a total remote cursus and we will send you all the technical information shortly so that you can continue to follow the course remotely. Please save your projects locally before November 3rd, because if not you will lose your work.

Shortly after your transfer your new team will be excited to welcome you in your new environment and point you to available resources.

If you previously chose not to be part of the new curriculum but would like to continue being part of 42, there will be a form posted in the #42sv_global_announcements channel on Slack, fill that out before November 26th. This will be your last chance to transfer from the old to new curriculum and continue activity with 42.

We have set up personalized support for academics during this time, so if you have any questions, please email go-remote@42.us.org (don't use others' emails as you won't receive an answer)

To the students currently residing in the dorms, we will be following up shortly with another email containing further information - please keep an eye out for an email from dorms-support@42.us.org.

As for the lab: In this transition, the lab located @ 6600 Dumbarton Cir. will be closed permanently. We will grant access to lab computers for active students from October 30th to November 3rd.

Thank you for your time and we will continue supporting you and wishing you the best!

May the Code Be With You Always,

42 Silicon Valley

I had an inkling that this could be true, sometime during Spring/Summer
when people were started to get fired and the newly hired director being
unlisted from the "Team" part of the website. While I didn't want to believe it,
I did check in during the summer multiple times, checking the differences between
the way back machine in different dates to see who was still employed there, then
cross referenced their Linkedin's just to be sure. Well, most people were let go
sometime from August through October. They haven't been replying to emails in
months from what I can tell as well.

So what now? I think this website will now just be an archive of 42 Silicon
Valley, what it once was and was trying to bring to America. I'll have one final
update post later on, but for now, it's official: 42 Silicon Valley is no more.
There are other 42 campuses around the world that are doing much better and
42 Paris proper is still alive and kicking. But, from what I've seen, it might
be better to just self teach and/or go to college.
