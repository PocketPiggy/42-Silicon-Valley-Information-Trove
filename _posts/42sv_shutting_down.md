Covid-19 is really starting to take affect in the United States, especially the Bay Area and New York at the moment. 42 Silicon Valley has decided to shut their campus down immediately.
</p>


<div class='blog-transcription'>

To our 42 Community,

This is to inform you that we will be shutting down our campus effective today, <b>March 11th</b>,
as a result of COVID-19 concerns in our community. The 42 lab will remain closed until
<b>March 25th</b>. During this time, we will not be allowing visitors and all events
planned will be rescheduled. We did not come to this decision lightly as we are following
suit with the City of Fremont and the Bay Area community.

THank you all very much for your patience and understanding at this time, the well-being
and health of everyone at 42 Silicon Valley is our highest priority and we look forward
to resuming our activities on <b>March 25th</b>. If you have any questions or concerns,
please reach out to us at: contact@42.us.org

42 Staff
