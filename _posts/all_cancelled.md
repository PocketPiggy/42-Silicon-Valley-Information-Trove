Covid is really starting to ramp up, to take precautions, 42 Silicon Valley has decided to close not only the campus until May 4th, but also cancelled the July start date & Piscine.
</p>

<h3>Update: We have also made the decision to cancel the July 20th Start Date and July Piscine.</h3>

To our 42 Community,

Local, state, and federal governments have extended the Shelter-In_Place order to continue
to flat line and prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, we have also extended the
temporary closure of our campus to May 4th. The April Piscine is effectively cancelled,
and we have also made the decision to cancel the upcoming May 18th start date for new Cadets.

Thank you all very much for your patience and understanding at this time, the well-being
and health of everyone at 42 Silicon Valley continues to be our highest priority and we
look forward to resuming our activities on May 4th. If you have any questions or concerns,
please reach out to us at: contact@42.us.org
