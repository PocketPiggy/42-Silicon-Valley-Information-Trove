Whelp, due to the skyrocketing cases in the United States, 42 Silicon Valley has decided to cancel the October Piscine & start dates as well as the rest for 2020. With schools still kinda closed in California, this isn't looking too good for early 2020 in my opinion. There are no set future date for anything and again, they say to keep an eye out on their social media channels.

To our 42 Community,

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the final decision to cancel our
remaining Start Dates and Piscines. This was a difficult decision for us, but one
we had to take to continue ensuring the safety of all our students and staff.

We have no set any future dates yet, so please keep an eye out on our social media
channels and websites for updates. We thank you for your patience and continued
support for 42 Silicon Valley at this time. Take care and may the code be with you.

42 Staff
