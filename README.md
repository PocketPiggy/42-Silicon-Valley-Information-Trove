# UPDATE

42 Silicon Valley is no longer open. It closed sometime in <b>September ~ October of 2020.</b> This is now just an archive of information and some of it is still applicable to other 42/21 campuses.

Hello, a website specifically for accumulating all known information for 42 Silicon Valley, located in Fremont, California.

My reason for creating this project was that there wasn't much known about 42 SV
, so I had to spend hours and hours looking through the internet to find any
relevant information. Hopefully I've made it just a little bit easier for
anyone who might come across this website.
