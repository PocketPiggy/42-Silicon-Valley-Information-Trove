# 42 Silicon Valley Info

Hello, this is a single page application website specifically for
accumulating all known information for 42 Silicon Valley, located in Fremont, California.

My reason for creating this project was that there wasn't much known about 42 SV, so I had
to spend hours and hours looking through the internet to find any relevant information.
Hopefully I've made it just a little bit easier for anyone who might come across this website.

It's a work in progress.

Built with Create React App.
